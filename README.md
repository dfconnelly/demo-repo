# demo-repo

This is a simple repository to demonstrate the use of github at the Ezenwa Lab Meetint on 2/7/2017

Please fork this repository by pressing the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page.

Once you have forked the repository click the "Clone or Download" button on the righthand side of the page and copy the url found there.

Then open up your "shell" program inside the folder in which you want to store this repository on your computer. Do this by opening that folder, right clicking, and choosing the command "git bash" here (not sure of the mac command).

You should now see a command line shell. Simply type `git clone` and then paste the url you copied earlier and press enter.

You should now see a folder within your current folder called demo-repo. This is your downloaded version of this github repository!
