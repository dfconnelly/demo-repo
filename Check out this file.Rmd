This is just your regular every day rmarkdown file. This is where you put your explanatory or interpretive tex. It takes latex formatting so you can do things like make \textit{italics}.

Below this in the part of the document dentoed by the tick marks comes our code. The little {r} tells the compiler that it should be treated as R code.

```{r}
data<-rnbinom(n=1000, size=.5, mu=10)
print(data[5])

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(data)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Try adding a code chunk of your own! Then save this file and head back over to your shell. To (1) `git add` this file (2) `git commit -m ""` this file with a commit message in the quotes, and (3) `git push origin master` this file up to your github repository!
